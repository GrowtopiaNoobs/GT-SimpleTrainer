# GT-SimpleTrainer
Simple project to make your own GT trainer!

This project has been developed and tested on Dev-C++ 5.11: https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/
Also this isn't ready to use trainer! You need to find opcodes, edit and then compile it yourself!

Thanks following people for reporting bugs or helping with development:

**Warnng: In newer versions of Growtopia C++ trainers don't work and currently noone know fix for that!**
